advantanges of sharding
sclability
high availabilty 
better write throughput

disadvantages of sharding
data rebalancing if shard data grows dispropationatliy then data rebalancing/migrations would require database downtime
costly join operations
what if the schema changes this can affect the availibility of the system
referential integrity is compromised 
e.g of referentail integrity is when let say user from table t1 gets deleted or disabled and corresponding
products ordered by the user in table t2 are orphaned entries then it would cause the referential integrity issues
consistency is affected in above cases
maintaince cost is increasese

type of shardings -> horizontal/vertical/range based sharding/key-hash based sharding/directory based sharding

in case of hash based sharding whenever at event of database scaling there need to change in hash function
which would cause the database downtime -> can be overideen the consistent hashing


directory based sharding -> this helps us to mitigate the issue of elastic scaling in-consistent hashing
we taking hit on latency here as well as there is a single point of failure what if our look server goes down
single point of failure can be avoided with master slave architecture to choose slave as master or do some sort of
election to choose of the slave as a master

when we should opt for sharding?
at a point where single database can't handle the requests
adding some complexity
having awareness of all the features

case study
cab service companies storing data based on geo location like based on cities store the user's and drivers data
social media platforms sotring the data based on userId and connections like graph depedency it would reduce the latency and consistency


sharding: method of distributing data across multiple machines
partationing: splitting a subset of data within same instance
vertical scaling has hardware limitations, so truley scalable system is horizontaly sclable
shard is at database level and partation is at database level, we awalys shard the database and partation the data

single shared could contain multiple partations
